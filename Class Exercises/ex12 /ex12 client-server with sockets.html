<p class="segment-header">Description:</p>
<p class="red">For this exercise you will need a java programming IDE, like Eclipse, installed on you computer.</p>
<p>The purpose of this exercise is to familiarize you with using sockets to establish connections between a client (android app) and a server (implemented in java). </p>
<p>In the previous node.js based server exercises there was no lasting connection  between the client and the server. After the server responded to the client's request the connection was lost.</p>
<p>Sockets allow you to established a connection between an client and server, much like a telephone call, that allow messages to flow between them until the connection is closed by either end. While the connection is active the client and server can either communicate in a request-response manner or it can be programmed so that client and server can send each other unsolicited (asynchronous) messages. In this exercise we will use only request-response messaging while the connection is active. That is, the client will send requests and the server will respond to each one. The server will not send unsolicited messages to the client.</p>
<p>The server will be built in java. The demo code provides the server skeleton code as an eclipse project. The client will be an android app. You can test the client server on localhost by having your android app access the server on the special IP address 10.0.2.2. </p>

<p class="red">You need to demonstrate your exercise to the TA or Prof. before you leave the class to get credit for it. Marks: 2 or completion, 1 for partial progress, 0 for no show or no progress. (A mark of 1 can be upgraded to 2 is show us your completed work within one week of this exercise.)</p>

<p class="segment-header"><span class="black-bold">Preliminary:</span></p>
<p>It is common for programmers to leave themselves <span class="code">//TODO</span> comments in their code. The demo code for this exercise has such <span class="code">//TODO</span> comments to indicate where you need to make modifications. You can reveal their locations in android studio and eclipse as follows.</p>
<p>In android studio:</p>

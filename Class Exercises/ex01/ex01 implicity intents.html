<p class="segment-header">Description:</p>
<p>The purpose of this exercise is to review Activities and intents in Android applications. This exersise should seem like review from 1601.</p>
<p class="red">You need to demonstrate your exercise to the TA or Prof. before you leave the class to get credit for it. If you complete, or make significant progress on the exercise you will get a mark of 2. If you make some progress you will get a mark of 1 and can &quot;upgrade&quot; that mark to a 2 by showing your completed work within one week of this exercise. 0 marks for a no-show or unsufficient progress.</p>

<p class="segment-header"><span class="black-bold">Background:</span></p>
<p><span class="black-bold">Acitivties</span> in android manage user interaction with a user interface screen. Activities have a behaviour component coded in java and represented by a subclass of <span class="code">Activity</span>. (e.g. <span class="code">MainActivity.java</span>) Activities also have a screen <span class="code">layout</span> resource represented by an XML file (e.g. <span class="code">activity_main.xml</span>) </p>
<p>A <span class="black-bold">layout</span> defines a set of user interface objects (<span class="code">Button</span>, <span class="code">TextView</span>, ...) and their postion on the screen. Defined in an XML file.</p>
<p>Intents in android represent an intended type activity desired and data to be passed to the activity. The are instances of the <span class="code">Intent</span> class. <span class="black-bold">Explicit intents</span> identify the intended activity by it's class, <span class="black-bold">implicit intents</span> identify activities by the kind of operation desired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="segment-header"><span class="black-bold">Demo Code</span></p>
<p>Open and run the project in the <span class="code">demo_code</span> folder. It is essentially our &quot;hello world&quot; project with minor modifications. It should open an app that lets you visit a web page using an <span class="black-bold">implicit intent</span>-based activity and should allow you to enter a name display it on another <span class="black-bold">explicit</span> intent-based activity: <span class="code">NameActivity</span>. The app screen should look as follows.</p>

<p class="segment-header"><span class="black-bold">Problem 1)</span></p>
<p>It might be necessary to get information about the actual device you are testing your code on. The following java method will produce a string with a lot of the device's info.</p>
<pre class="black-bold">
private String getDeviceInfo(){
        String s = "Device Info:";
        try {

            s += "\n OS Version: "      + System.getProperty("os.version")  + 
                    "(" + android.os.Build.VERSION.INCREMENTAL + ")";
            s += "\n OS API Level: "    + android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK_INT;
            s += "\n Device: "          + android.os.Build.DEVICE;
            s += "\n Model (and Product): " + android.os.Build.MODEL   +
                    " ("+ android.os.Build.PRODUCT + ")";
            s += "\n RELEASE: "         + android.os.Build.VERSION.RELEASE;
            s += "\n BRAND: "           + android.os.Build.BRAND;
            s += "\n DISPLAY: "         + android.os.Build.DISPLAY;
            s += "\n HARDWARE: "        + android.os.Build.HARDWARE;
            s += "\n Build ID: "        + android.os.Build.ID;
            s += "\n MANUFACTURER: "    + android.os.Build.MANUFACTURER;
            s += "\n SERIAL: "          + android.os.Build.SERIAL;
            s += "\n USER: "            + android.os.Build.USER;
            s += "\n HOST: "            + android.os.Build.HOST;

        } catch (Exception e) {
            Log.e(TAG, "Error getting Device INFO");
        }
        return s;
    }
</pre>
<p>In your <span class="code">MainActivity</span> class add the code necessary to print the device info to the logcat terminal window using an expresssion like:</p>
<p class="code">Log.i(TAG, getDeviceInfo());</p>
<p>In my case the output looks like the following:</p>

<p class="segment-header"><span class="black-bold">Problem 2)</span></p>
<p class="segment-header"><span class="black-bold">Implicit Intents</span></p>
<p>Study the code that launches the browser activity when the &quot;Launch Browser&quot; button is pressed:</p>

<pre class="black-bold">        
final Button webViewBtn = (Button) findViewById(R.id.startWebViewBtn);
        webViewBtn.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            public void onClick(View v) {
                userURL = urlName.getText().toString();
                if (userURL.length() != 0) {
                    Intent webIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(userURL));
                    startActivity(webIntent);
                }
            }
        });
</pre>
<p>Notice the activity being launched is not of a named class but instead is handled by any application on your device willing to handle an <span class="code">Intent.ACTION_VIEW</span> intent. Thus we are starting an activity using an implicit intent.</p>
<p>Given <span class="code">String</span> variables <span class="code">emailAddress, emailBody, emailSubject</span> the following implicit intent will start one of the email applications on your device and send an email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre>
<span class="black-bold">Intent emailIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SENDTO, Uri.parse("mailto:" + emailAddress));

emailIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_SUBJECT, emailSubject);
emailIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, emailBody);

startActivity(Intent.createChooser(emailIntent, "Email Client ..."));
</span></pre>
<p>Create two new <span class="code">EditText</span> items:</p>
<pre class="black-bold">
    private EditText emailAddressText;
    private EditText emailMessageBodyText;
</pre>
<p>and a &quot;Send&quot; button that will allow the user to fill in an email address and a text body and then send an email by pressing the &quot;Send&quot; button. (You can hardcode the subject string for the message). (Note if no email address and content is entered in the text fields the email app chooser will not launch). Use the app to send yourself an email, and then show us that it arrived in your inbox. </p>
<p><span class="red">[Be aware this will not likely work on a virtual device -they don't typically have an email client installed. If you don't have a real device you will have to borrow a neighbour's  to test your code or start google'ing for ways to install an email client on a virtual device. So even something this simple is beyond the basic virtual device and a good reason to get a real one.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/problem2.png" width="633" height="842"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="segment-header"><span class="black-bold">Problem 3)</span></p>
<p>Modify the code so that if the user types &quot;device info&quot; for the email content the email message will actually contain all the device info from problem 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="red">When you have completed these problems demonstrate your code to  the TA or Prof. to get credit for the tutorial.</span>Â </p>
